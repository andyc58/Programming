Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I configured the main game and allowed the user to choose to play against either the computer or another player. I also allowed the user to stop the game whenever, 
and made it re-prompt the user if invalid input was entered.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not yet made it so that it would display a victory message along with the score after the user ends the game. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have decided to change my project entirely because I was not getting anywhere with it due to very little communication from my previous group. Now, I am working solo on a twist on the game of Rock Paper Scissors. The project will be completed in Python.
