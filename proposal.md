# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

You-Down

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An ios program that lets you download youtube videos and music

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

A YouTube downloader is a software that allows you to download videos and/or music directly from YouTube. It does this by grabbing the url of the YouTube video,  fetching certain data about the video, and converts the data into an mp4 file that can be downloaded. For audio, it is the same thing and converts the data to an mp3 file. It will also fetch song information such as artist, album, etc. and edit the metadata of that file with it, so that the user can organize their songs better on their computer. We are maybe planning on using a python library called pytube3 to help with this.  Since this is an ios app, we will also be using the swift programming language.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Karan Chelani - tul24434@temple.edu - Chong Li

Sam Lovos - tui90088@temple.edu - Tamara Katic

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We will have it download YouTube videos and convert them to an mp4 format.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We will have it download both audio and video files (mp3 and mp4 conversion). 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We will allow it  to download multiple videos at once (playlist downloading) and/or look up the song information to help the user organize their songs.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Our next step is to do more research more on how the pytube3 library works and what other kinds of libraries exist in helping us do this.  Additionally, we will need to understand the swift programming language in order to create it for ios.
